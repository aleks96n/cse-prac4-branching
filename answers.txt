2.Can't do a task without making a mistake it seems :D Branch package was merged with master
git branch --merge when on master branch using git checkout master

3. git rev-list --all --count 
16 

4. package has Added package
But I did not use the terminal, I looked at the website. git log package showed master commits, I
am guessing because package was merged with master or something.
I would like to know how I could know without using github :D
